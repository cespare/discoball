discoball
=========

`discoball` is a tool to filter streams and colorize patterns. It functions somewhat like `egrep --color`,
except that it can highlight multiple patterns (in different colors). Patterns are arbitrary ruby regexes that
are matched against the entire line.

Usage
-----

    $ discoball [options] <pattern1 pattern2 ...>

where options are:

  * `--group-colors` or `-g`: Color all matches of the same pattern with the same color
  * `--one-color` or `-o`: Highlight all matches with a single color
  * `--match-any` or `-m`: Only print lines matching an input pattern
  * `--match-all` or `-a`: Only print lines matching all input patterns
  * `--help` or `-h`: Print the help message

Examples
--------

  * Highlight instances of "foo" and "bar" in the text of `myfile.txt`:

        $ cat myfile.txt | discoball foo bar

  * Highlight paths of processes running out of `/usr/sbin/`:

        $ ps -ef | discoball --one-color --match-any '/usr/sbin/.*$'

  * I wrote discoball for use with [Steve Losh's todo-list tool, t](https://github.com/sjl/t). I put tags on
    my tasks annotated with `+` (inspired by [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/)):

        $ t Make an appointment with the dentist +health

    When I list my tasks (using `t`), I use discoball to highlight the tags with different colors:

        $ t | discoball '\+\S+'

    I can even do some fancier stuff to list particular labels. I have the following function defined in my
    `.bashrc`:

    ``` bash
    function tl() {
      if [ -z  "$1" ]; then
        t | discoball '\+\S+'
      else
        t | discoball -a "${@/#/\+}"
      fi
    }
    ```

    I can use this as follows:

        $ tl               # ~> Show the list of tasks, with tags highlighted
        $ tl health urgent # ~> Show only tasks tagged with 'health' and 'urgent'

Installation
------------

The easiest way to get `discoball` is by using pip (or easy_install): `$ pip install discoball`.
